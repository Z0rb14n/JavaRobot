# JavaRobot
A higher level wrapper for Java's Robot class.

It allows users to type in strings by calling robot.simplerType(str); instead of manually programming in individual key codes for strings, and allows for easier screenshots of the screen.

Note that the main class is entirely optional - only the wrapper is needed (JavaRobot is the main class, RobotWrapper is the wrapper).
